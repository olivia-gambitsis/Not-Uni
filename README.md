Not-Uni is a Web App built I built with a team of 4 people. //
//
This app was made with the idea that there are too many free learning resources available on the internet. Sometimes when you want to learn about a topic, it can be overwhelming trying to find a good place to start. Not-Uni is a site where users can sign up, and collate free resources from the internet (which they found useful) into 'modules' for other uses to view, or to come back to themselves. We named it 'Not-Uni' because eventually we would want it to be a place where you could learn for free rather than going to University. The current site only has programming languages as topics, however in the future we would like users to have the ability to make a module cover any topic they desire. //

## Getting Started

If you'd like to add to our project here's how to get started:
```
cd workspace
git clone + https link
cd myRepo
git checkout -b feature/yourFeatureName
code .
npm i
npm run knex migrate:latest
npm run knex seed: run
npm run dev
```
You should be good to go! Remember to checkout and pull from the development branch regularly to ensure your feature branch is not too behind updates. Also checkout the Git Protocol at the bottom of this ReadMe for further details.

### Having Problems?
If you're having problems it could be because you do not have the .env file set up correctly. Come and see us or send us a message and we can try and help.

## Design 

We have used Figma for our design and Wireframe production, check it out below.

## Database

We have used dbdiagram.io for our database design. Check it out below.
*we have used Firebase for our users table

## Git Protocol
curtosey of Hortense:

* Clone & Make a branch Steps 1 - 4
* Merge your feature Steps 5 - 11

## 1. Clone
```
cd workspace
git clone + https link
cd myRepo
```
## 2. Make a branch using the name of your feature
```
git checkout -b feature/aFeature  
code .  
```
## 3. Instal modules & reset the database
```
npm i
npm run knex migrate:latest
npm run knex seed:run
```
## 4. Commit & Push your branch
```
git status 
git add .  
git commit -m “commit message”  
git push origin myBranch  
```


# MERGE TIME!! 
* Feature is done, ready to create a pull request to Development?? 

## 5. Commit your branch
```
git add .  
git commit -m “readyToMerge”   
```

## 6. Pull Development into your branch, open VScode & deal with the conflicts there.

```
git pull origin Development
code .
```
## 7. Vscode

* Files marked C = Conflict
* Files marked M = Modified
* <<<<< Head  = This is you! Current changes, you are HEAD
* <<<<<< Incoming change = pulled in from the Development branch

## 8. Any conflicts or changes need to be saved, added, & committed again

```
git add .
git commit -m “mergeTime”
git push origin myBranch
```
## 9. Github - create pull request

* Create pull request from mybranch to Development (on github)
* Tell the git keeper, they will merge the pull request and there should be 0 conflicts as you have already resolved these in your branch.

# Create a new branch with a new name
```
git checkout -b feature/myNextFeature  
code .  
```

* Reset datase
```
rm server/db/dev.sqlite3
npm run knex migrate:latest
npm run knex seed:run
```
